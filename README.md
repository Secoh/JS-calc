1. Avia Calc

From METAR weather report and geo-location data, derive Temperature, Humidity, and Density Altitude. Estimate cloud bottom level.
When Course, Airspeed, and Altitude are also given, get magnetic heading and ETA for the flight. For runways, get headwind/crosswind components.
For the Airspeed, estimate U-Turn diameter and stall safety margin for different bank angles.

2. Weight and Balance

Standard Weight and Balance problem for airplanes. Pre-programmed typical W&B figures and limitations for Cessna 152, 172, 182 (certain models).

3. Azimuth and Distance

Given the geographic coordinates for the vantage point and the destination, calculate true and magnetic azimuth, and distance between points.
(Inclination is given manually.)
